### Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed on your system.

### Option 1: Arch User Repository (AUR)

For Arch Linux users, torrcli is available in the AUR. This is the recommended method for easy installation and updates.

You can use any AUR helper like yay, paru, etc.
```bash
yay -S torrcli
```

### Option 2: Manual Install (Any Linux Distribution)

**pipx is required before installing so use apt/pacman/rpm to install pipx before continuing**

If you're not using Arch or prefer manual installation, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aayushkdev/torrcli.git
cd torrcli
```

2. **Run the Installer Script:**
```bash
./install.sh
```

3. **To Uninstall:**
```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

`torrcli` uses a configuration file to allow you to customize its behavior, such as download directories, port settings, and more.

The default configuration file is located at `~/.config/torrcli/config.conf`.

## üí° Usage

Detailed commands:

- `torrcli add <source> [--save/-s SAVE_PATH] [--stream/-t]`
    Downloads a torrent from the specified source.

    - `<source>`: Can be a magnet link (e.g., `"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:..."`) or a path to a `.torrent` file (e.g., `/path/to/your/file.torrent`).

    - `--save/-s SAVE_PATH`: (Optional) Specify the directory where the downloaded files will be saved. If not provided, the `default_save_path` from your `config.conf` will be used.

    - `--stream/-t`: (Optional) Specify if the files will be downloaded sequentially

- `torrcli search <torrent-name> [--save/-s SAVE_PATH] [--stream/-t]`
    Searches for a torrent from various sources and lets you interactively select a torrent to download.
    It has all the same flags as `torrcli add`
